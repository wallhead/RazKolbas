# Implementation checkpoint

## Scope

The complete T01–T24 plan in `../RazKolbas_Codex_Handoff/docs/plans/2026-09-19-razkolbas-implementation.md` remains the target. This checkpoint is not a product completion claim.

| Task | Implementation | Build/test | Game/GPU |
|---|---|---|---|
| T01 | Inventory and environment tools implemented; host dependency sources pinned; production vendor SDK selection open | 4 inventory regressions PASS; 57 extracted files VERIFIED; original archives MISSING_REFERENCE | NOT RUN |
| T02 | In progress | NOT RUN | NOT RUN |
| T03–T24 | Not implemented | NOT RUN | NOT RUN |

## Commands run

- `pwsh -File tests/integration/Inventory.Tests.ps1`: 4 tests failed before implementation, then 4 passed.
- `pwsh -File tools/Inventory-References.ps1 -ReferenceRoot . -Verify`: exit 1, 57 verified entries, 2 missing original archives, no hash mismatches.
- `pwsh -File tools/Inspect-Environment.ps1`: exit 0; local JSON under `artifacts/local/`.

## Decisions

- Preserve the supplied handoff directory; build implementation at the repository root. The original prompt path was absent; the available `CODEX_PROMPT.md` provides the implementation instructions.
- Initialize the unborn repository on `codex/razkolbas-bootstrap`; no worktree can be based on a nonexistent HEAD.
- Use exact source commits through CMake FetchContent and `runtime/dependencies.lock.json`, avoiding two conflicting dependency manifests. No vcpkg manifest is claimed to exist.
- Pin CommonLib 3.6.0 for C++20. The native-only bootstrap will use its SKSE interface declarations without eagerly initializing its relocation database. Engine integration remains T05.
- Supplied extracted files are sufficient for static RE; missing original archive containers do not block it.

## Next action

T02: build the native-only host, test lifecycle and SKSE exports, then implement T03/T04. Start targeted T08 static RE from verified Fallout DLL/PDB alongside subsequent independent work. A Skyrim test installation is still needed for game validation.
