# Implementation checkpoint

## Scope

The complete T01–T24 plan in `../RazKolbas_Codex_Handoff/docs/plans/2026-09-19-razkolbas-implementation.md` remains the target. This checkpoint is not a product completion claim.

| Task | Implementation | Build/test | Game/GPU |
|---|---|---|---|
| T01 | Inventory and environment tools implemented; host dependency sources pinned; production vendor SDK selection open | 4 inventory regressions PASS; 57 extracted files VERIFIED; original archives MISSING_REFERENCE | NOT RUN |
| T02 | Native-only SKSE DLL, guarded lifecycle, logging, build presets, CI and explicit staging implemented | Debug DLL built; 3 CTest groups PASS, including actual DLL load/export checks | Skyrim load NOT RUN |
| T03 | Shared variant-typed INI schema, requested SR policy, transactions and temporal invariants implemented; full FG pairing/resource contracts remain open | 7 Debug CTest groups PASS; invalid numbers/enums, locked file, failed replacement, reset epoch and generated frames covered | NOT RUN |
| T04–T24 | Not implemented, except early T08 static investigation | NOT RUN | NOT RUN |

## Commands run

- `pwsh -File tests/integration/Inventory.Tests.ps1`: 4 tests failed before implementation, then 4 passed.
- `pwsh -File tools/Inventory-References.ps1 -ReferenceRoot . -Verify`: exit 1, 57 verified entries, 2 missing original archives, no hash mismatches.
- `pwsh -File tools/Inspect-Environment.ps1`: exit 0; local JSON under `artifacts/local/`.
- `pwsh -File tools/Build.ps1 -Preset win-dev`: exit 0; `unit.host`, `integration.inventory`, `integration.plugin` PASS. Three lifecycle tests failed before implementation; the DLL integration test failed before the DLL existed.
- `pwsh -File tools/Build.ps1 -Preset win-release`: T02 Release DLL and 3 CTest groups PASS.
- T03: `unit.config`, `unit.policy`, `unit.history`, `unit.frame_identity` failed before implementation and passed afterward; the supplied INI round-trips through the schema. All 7 Debug groups passed together.

## Decisions

- Preserve the supplied handoff directory; build implementation at the repository root. The original prompt path was absent; the available `CODEX_PROMPT.md` provides the implementation instructions.
- Initialize the unborn repository on `codex/razkolbas-bootstrap`; no worktree can be based on a nonexistent HEAD.
- Use exact source commits through CMake FetchContent and `runtime/dependencies.lock.json`, avoiding two conflicting dependency manifests. No vcpkg manifest is claimed to exist.
- Pin CommonLib 3.6.0 for C++20. The native-only bootstrap will use its SKSE interface declarations without eagerly initializing its relocation database. Engine integration remains T05.
- Supplied extracted files are sufficient for static RE; missing original archive containers do not block it.

## Next action

T03: implement shared settings, capability and temporal policy. T08 static RE has started: the matched reference contains an NR module-name IAT shim. Full evidence and native probe remain in progress. A Skyrim test installation is still needed for game validation.
